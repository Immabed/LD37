Entry to Ludum Dare 37 (A 72 hour game jam)

## Summary
This is an attempted entry to Ludum Dare 37, a 72 hour game jam competition. There were three main contributors, and two others who provided some input and a few assets.

The working title for the game is Breaker Breaker Space Trucker, and it is a game where you manage a space fairing cargo ship, travelling from space station to space station, keeping systems functional, upgrading your ship, accepting cargo contracts, and buying fuel.

The game was not finished during the game jam, and though some work has been done since, remains unfinished. The majority of the game logix is in place, but the UI is not fully connected, and the game is not balanced.

## Technical Details
This game was developed in the Unity game engine, version 5.5.0. It should be able to be run in that version of the Unity editor.

## Contributors
The primary contributors are Immabed, wenchance, and TheAJAXX, who collectively designed the game and its mechanics.

Immabed: Programmer and primary developer in Unity, design

wenchance: Art, design

TheAJAXX: UI, design

Burrowdizzy: Creative input

TheTaciturn (not on github): Character art, background art

## Usage
There is currently no licence, but we ask that this game is not taken and treated as someone else's creation.  Note that the code for this game was rushed, as it was developed on an extremely tight schedule without much planning, so some aspects of the game's design would greatly benefit from refactoring.
